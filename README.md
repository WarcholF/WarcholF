# Hi, I'm Filip - TUL Second Degree Student

ðŸ’» I'm passionate about creating **fullstack applications** and constantly expanding my knowledge in the field of web development.

ðŸ“š Currently, I am honing my skills in **React** and **Symfony**, while applying them in real-world projects at work.  
Although I don't frequently publish repositories here, most of my work involves professional projects that showcase my expertise in building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
